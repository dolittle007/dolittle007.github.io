## Summary

In the last 12+ years I've been spending my time working on a number of projects, 
most of them with the central theme of exploring, analyzing and visualizing biological data 
in a context of complicated biology. 

This means that I've been revisiting the core concepts behind methods for 
association-relationship between biological data and biological stories. 
using different approaches from a broad range of disciplines (e.g. statistics, 
epidemiology and bioinformatics).

In particular, I've done a lot of programming and reading for genetics, genomics and data analysis.  
Behind all the stuff that Iâ€™ve done there is a single idea and goal: 
**to make all the biological data talk the beauty of life**.


## Overall Interests

There are 3 major topics that I'm hooked to:
 
- I really like [reading](/read) books associated with statistics, Python and JavaScript, especially those involve data visualization.
- I'm fascinated with the use of biological data to understand biology.
- I'm a passionate Python user.


## Blog

Occasionally, I like to talk about data analysis, genetics, genomics, data visualization, statistics, Python, R and 
related stuff in my blog [Data Beauty](/blog).


## Trifecta

What I like about my "job" is that:

1. It can be applied to practically life sciences and relevant disciplines;
2. Consequently, it has allowed me to open the doors of the beauty of life;
3. But most important, it has given me the fortune to work with very smart and talented 
people from all over the world (from whom I've learned so much).

# About this website

This website is my personal space where I try to declutter my ideas and put my 
projects in order. This is easier said than done.
  
- It only happens after many iterations and refinements
- During days and nights in front of a computer
- Fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and tea
- Sometimes listening to music, sometimes in silence
